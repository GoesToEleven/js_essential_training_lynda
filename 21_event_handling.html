<!--
experiment with JS in the three places above
comment / uncomment the different JS locations

JS is parser blocking
JS blocks DOM construction
(fyi: css blocks JS - the JS won't execute until CSSOM created)

with JS at highest location
JS executes, then DOM built
JS not have reference to img
the click event listener for img won't work

with JS async
JS waits until DOM and CSSOM are created to execute
the click event listener will work

with JS at lowest location
when JS executes, the DOM is mostly created
and the CSSOM is entirely created



you could also do the below
to ensure that your DOM and CSSOM are created before JS executes

function executeEventHandlers() {
        var myImg = document.querySelector('img');
        function myFunction() {
            alert('You clicked the image');
            }
        myImg.addEventListener('click', myFunction, false);
}

window.onload = function() {
    executeEventHandlers();
}
