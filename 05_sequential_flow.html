<h1>Simple HTML Page</h1>

    This is a very simple HTML page.

<ul>
    <li>An H1 Tag</li>
    <li>Two paragraphs</li>
    <li>An unordered list</li>
</ul>

<script>
    alert("three");

     The Critical RENDERing Path:
     1 - Get the HTML - PARSE HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
     2 - Get the CSS - Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree (RECALCULATE STYLE).
     3 - Combine HTML & CSS - Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree (LAYOUT ).
     4 - Figure out sizes - Run LAYOUT on the render tree to compute geometry of each node.
     5 - Put it on the screen - PAINT the individual nodes to the screen.

     JavaScript is PARSEr blocking
         JavaScript blocks DOM construction
     wonâ€™t execute until CSSOM created
         CSS blocks JavaScript
         CSS is RENDER blocking

     To render:
        need DOM
        need CSSOM
        need javascript

     Best Practices:
        put javascript at bottom of page
            just before closing body tag </body>
        put stylesheets at the top
            in the head tag </head>
            minimize number of stylesheets
            minify stylesheets
        make your JavaScript async when possible
            makes it no longer parser blocking
        eliminate unnecessary JavaScript from CRP
